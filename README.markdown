dns_compare
==============
Compare data from a BIND zone file to data returned by an authoritative DNS server.

Purpose
-------
Use this tool to verify the data being returned by an authoritative DNS server matches
the data in a zone file.

Motivation
----------
It is very helpful when migrating from one DNS server to another to be able to
verify that all records imported correctly.

In my case, I used this tool to help me migrate multiple domains from
Windows 2000 DNS and GoDaddy DNS (which both export BIND zone files) into Amazon's
Route53 DNS service.  With this tool, I could confidently prove that all records
properly imported into Route53 before changing the whois records for each domain.

UPDATED (7/11/2013): Cleaned up the script and output a bit and refactored a few things while migrating
a set of domains from Ziergo to Dyn.

Installation
------------

    pip install git+http://github.com/jfchevrette/dns_compare.git#egg=dns_compare


Example Usage:
--------------
Basic operation:

    $ dns_compare -z example.com --file example.com.zone --server 10.1.1.1
    ............................................X
    (MIS-MATCH) query: nss4.example.com.
     Expected:  300 IN A 142.229.40.28
     Received:  900 IN A 142.229.40.28
    ...X
    (MIS-MATCH) query: www.example.com.
     Expected:  200 IN A 91.139.129.128
     Received:  900 IN A 91.139.129.128
    X
    (MIS-MATCH) query: www.example.com.
     Expected:  300 IN AAAA 2001:4800:1078:2256:78C8:1542:FF04:6BCB
     Received:  900 IN AAAA 2001:4800:1078:2256:78c8:1542:ff04:6bcb
    ......................done
    
    Results:
    Matches:      69
    Mis-matches:  3

Verbose:

    $ dns_compare -z example.com --file example.com.zone --server 10.1.1.1 --verbose
	----
	(Match) query: www.example.com. ...
	Expected:  0 IN CNAME example.com.
	Received:  0 IN CNAME example.com.
	----
	(MIS-MATCH) query: example.com. ...
	Expected:  60 IN A 10.0.0.1
	Got     :  60 IN A 10.0.0.20

By default, SOA and NS records are ignored because these records are likely
to change when migrating a zone between DNS services..  Specify `--soa` or `--ns` option,
respectively, to enable checking of SOA and NS records.

Comparing TTLs can be disabled with `-t` option. This is useful when transferring DNS to a provider
that offers only specific TTL values.

TODO:
-----
- Print separate count of NXDOMAIN in results?
